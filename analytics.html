<h4><p align="left" STYLE="color:#6E1C53;"><i>I believe in data-driven business decisions. A person who combines unique and experienced insight, solid statistics & programming skills, and a "it's not done until it's done right" spirit is my definition of an outstanding Data Scientist.  Being a patient, precise, and persuasive communicator, I know how to deliver the right message to both data geeks and non data-savvy individuals.

<h4><p align="left">Below are some of my recent analytics projects during internships, in school, and for fun. Although they cover quite a few fields that include topic modeling, machine learning, advertisement, user growth, finance and labor economics, the main spirit and quantitative methods were, as a matter of fact, very consistent. I investigate complex problems through expertise in disciplines within the fields of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. R, Python, SQL and some visualization languages like JavaScript/D3 are my most-loved tools, while I'm holding high hope for <a href="http://julialang.org">Julia</a> too. Code <a href="https://github.com/RachelShuyanWang">here</a>.

The lack of user engagement would reduce Yelp traffic, and slow down the metabolism of the website in the long run. This paper applied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">LDA</a> and other <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/topicmodeling.html">topic modeling</a> methods on the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge">Yelp Academic Dataset</a> to design a system that can automatically recommend potentially high quality reviews.

The visualized results showed that: 1) usage patterns for Facebook, Twitter and news are lowest on Mondays and Tuesdays. 2) And social media data, Facebook and Twitter, had higher positive, strong and weak word matches than news data. 3) There was a 5 hour lag time between news Release updates and Facebook for the same keywords. 4) The trending keywords show a close relationship with the timeline of major events.

By not only analyzing opportunities won, but also the lost ones, the report has revealed the real reasons a seller loses a case and different stages to close an online ads deal, which are can be neglected by company stategists at times.

In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_in_differences">Difference-in-Differences model</a>, year 2005 proved to be a turning point where the relative positions of two schools have changed significantly. There is also a chance that the rise in salary and larger salary gap are both affecting the academic performance of students. Teaching experience has proved to be a significant factor influencing the academic performance of students.
